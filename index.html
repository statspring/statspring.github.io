<p>Serving is faster and cheaper than ever before and we all love digital ocean, but for many purposes Wordpress and database driven apps and resources are just overkill and slowing down the web, and static site generators are still lets face it awfully geeky and technical for non techie types who can't spell markdown. There's a faster better cheaper distributed way we can change this. And we're going to let you try it very soon. </p>

<p>Net neutrality should scare the piss out of you, yes still. It can still happen though we all commend the US President for his thoughtful and timely attention to the issue and related political appointments, research If not for the last minute phone call from the governor so to speak, we'd be seriously in it right about now. Or would we? We've pondered that fear with some smart people who agree we can take the web more into the hands of the individual the end user. <i>Minimize data streams in every way</i></p>

<p>In developing our solutions we have been looking at alternative outlets and communications models, and truly its amazing how much is undone despite the webs frantic mission to be better faster safer and more accessible. </p>

<p>These are the technologies that we are using to do more with less. To speed up while slowing down. They have the power to safeguard, and enrich our lives, while tripling our productivity. They may even have the power to extend our lives, indefinitely. </p>

<a id="designing-a-new-world" class="anchor" href="#designing-a-new-world" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designing a New World</h3>

<p>We're doing our small part to begin bringing some of these technologies into our daily lives, but first we want to make sure the right foundation is laid. and that means. Safeguarding our privacy, limiting our dependence on falsely inflated commodities like oil, and an economy based on theoretical value as determined by confidence levels amongst a majority who is constantly being manipulated. Many things will have to change open source is good but the individual cannot be forgotten in the shadow of the collective. We need to find the golden triangle to bring balance symbiotic harmony amongst the many the few and the individual.</p>
