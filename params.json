There's a faster better cheaper distributed way we can change this. And we're going to let you try it very soon. \r\n\r\nIf net neutrality didnt get a last minute phone call from the governor so to speak, we'd be in it right about now. Or would we? We've pondered that fear with some smart people who agree we can take the web more into the hands of the individual the end user.. \r\n \r\nIn developing our solutions we have been looking at alternative outlets and communications models, and truly its amazing how much is undone despite the webs frantic mission to be better faster safer and more accessible. \r\n\r\n[ ] Containerization\r\n[ ] Virtualization\r\n[ ] Ephemeral Data Life\r\n[ ] Client Side Processing\r\n[ ] Enhanced Metrics\r\n\r\n###Faster Than you Think\r\nThese are the technologies that we are using to do more with less. To speed up while slowing down. They have the power to safeguard, and enrich our lives, while tripling our productivity. They may even have the power to extend our lives, indefinitely. \r\n\r\n### Designing a New World\r\nWe're doing our small part to begin bringing some of these technologies into our daily lives, but first we want to make sure the right foundation is laid. and that means. Safeguarding our privacy, limiting our dependence on falsely inflated commodities like oil, and an economy based on theoretical value as determined by confidence levels amongst a majority who is constantly being manipulated. Many things will have to change open source is good but the individual cannot be forgotten in the shadow of the collective. We need to find the golden triangle to bring balance symbiotic harmony amongst the many the few and the individual.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
